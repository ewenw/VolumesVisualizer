Tool:
3D volumes of rotation visualization learning tool

1. UI lets user draw a non-overlapping 2D shape
2. Stores shape outline in 2D pixel array
3. User chooses to rotate around X or Y axis
4. Outline is rendered at different angles around axis to form 3D volume
5. Area is estimated with trapezoidal approximation
